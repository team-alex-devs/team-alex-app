[//]: # (TODO)

# Contributing

1. Find an issue to work on or that you are assigned

2. Create a branch for the issue named

   > `{issue-number}/{description}` 

   Where `issue-number` is the number associated with the issue (ie. `#1`) and the `description` is a brief description
   of the issue

2. Create a commit for each batch of related changes (that is, the smallest changes that cannot be seperated)

3. Name the commit following the format 

   > {type}({scope}): {description}

   Where `type` is `bug, chore, feature, ...`, `scope` is something like `api, fe, be, ...` and `description` is
   specifically what the commit changes.
4. Complete issue, and then create a pull request describing your changes. The PR description must
   contain `resolves {issue-number}`
